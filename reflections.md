# Q1 End of Lessons Reflection

### List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences
1. Arithmetic Operators - These are operators used to do operations using variables. They encompass the arithmetic operations found in Math, such as: additon (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/ or % for decimal numbers only). This was a topic tackled in c++, therefore, something I am already familiar with. This topic was similarly taught and used this year in JS, so I was able to easily grasp it again.

2. Comparison Operators - These are Javascript operators used to compare two values. These operators are "==" for equal ("===" for strictly equal), "!=" for not equal, ">" for greater than (left greater than right), "<" for less than (left less than right), and finally, ">/<=" for less than or equal to or greater than or equal to. Through constant application, I was able to fully grasp and know this topic.

3. While Loop - A while loop is a kind of loop that repeats as long as the conditional expression is true. Again, this was a topic we had in c++, therefore a topic I'm already familiar with. The usage and syntax of this loop wasn't altered too much in JS, allowing me to use my prior knowledge to learn how to use it appropriately and properly in JS.

4. Output Statements - Output statements are what generates the output of your Javascript code. A few examples used in class of this are the statements including console.log and document.write. This topic was somewhat tackled during the lessons c++, the only difference being the syntax now in Javascript. Thus, using my prior knowledge on this subject, I was able to familiarize myself with the output statements in JS.

5. Variable Declaration - Variables, also known as holders or containers, require declaration statements to be used properly. In Javascript, the methods of declaring a variable are as follows: by using var, let, or const. Although we were taught how to declare variables last SY in c++, variable declaration methods differ in JS. However, I was able to learn this and grasp it rather quickly. 

### List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed

1. Functions - Functions, especially in Javascript, are essential in making codes and websites interactive for the viewer. Functions invoke or execute actions and overall, keep codes simpler and easier to understand. Ever since this was taught last year in c++, I've had a hard time with this function, specifically with calling it in the actual body of the code. I believe this is because I wasn't able to apply functions as much, thus making me not learn it too deeply.

2. For loops - A for loop is a kind of loop that runs all of the object's elements. This kind of loop keeps your code simple, concise, and short. I, however, am not very familiar with how to use this loop. I'm constantly confused on what to put inside the parentheses, and only get it working through chance. I believe this is because I have yet to fully master declaring an object's elements.

3. Nested loops - Nested loops are a kind of loop that is comprised of many loops. The most common version of this is the loop-within-a-loop kind. Although I understand the foundation and basics of creating loops, I struggle to make working, nested ones, where they all work together to create one big thing. I believe I just need more practice on applying this. 

4. Arrays - An array is a data structure used to store collections of elements under a single variable name. Arrays, once more, keep your codes shorter and easier to understand, input, and output. Due to the lack of coverage and application of this topic last year during the c++ lessons, I was unable to fully grasp and master it, thus making me unable to use arrays properly this year in Javascript.

5. Debugging - Debugging is the act of investigating, identifying, and solving bugs found in a code. I struggle to identify the bugs in my codes often, leading me to creating faulty, error-filled codes. I believe this is because I need more practice on application and familiarizing myself with the do's and don'ts of a certain coding style.

### Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items

1. Functions - I will study how to create a function and declare it in the body of a code, apply it through doing practice exercises and practice codes, and master it by slowly but surely starting to use it in more of my future, graded or non graded coding exercises.

2. For loops - Before anything, I will master the loops While and Do-While. Then, I will study the elements of an object and practice applying it through the first two loops, before practicing applying them in for loops. 

3. Nested loops - After somewhat mastering the first three kinds of loops, I will study the fundamentals of how nested loops work and how to make all loops inside it connecting and related. Then, I will practice this by applying nested loops in the very common, helpful exercise that is outputting a certain shape using "*".

4. Arrays - I will relearn the entire topic by myself, from the fundamentals, to mastering the basics, and applying it in code starting with simple exercises before moving on to harder exercises. This is the only way to ensure I am able to fully understand and grasp the topic at my own pace and using my own learning style.

5. Debugging - I will study and familiarize the do's and dont's of a certain coding style (ex. c++ always needing ;), and get better at identifying bugs through consistent, constant application with coding practice exercises.

### In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

Effective - The two most effective activities in class in my opinion are when we were tasked to complete 5 exercises from CodeChef and when we were tasked to create a guessing game website. This is because the CodeChef exercises forced me to recall my past lessons in c++, remember them fully, and apply them. This really helped jog my memory and remind me how to code. The guessing game website task allowed me to apply my recent learnings of JS and helped me to further understand the fundamentals and how to use them.

Ineffective - In my opinion, no activity was ineffective. It is my own fault that I was not able to grasp the topic, if ever I had trouble with it.
